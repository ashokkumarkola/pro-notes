📘 Markdown Notes Style Guide

1. Headings — Hierarchy & Structure

# H1 → Title of the doc (e.g., "Python Basics")

## H2 → Main sections (e.g., "1. Introduction")

### H3 → Sub-sections (e.g., "Variables")

#### H4 → Sub-sub-sections (rare, edge cases/examples)

💡 Rule: Each .md file should have 1 H1 at the top, and then use ## onward.

1. Text Styling — Highlighting Key Points

Bold → important concepts:
**Object-Oriented Programming** is a paradigm based on classes and objects.

Italics → new terms, emphasis:
Python is an _interpreted_ language.

Inline code → keywords, commands, code elements:
Use `pip install` to install packages.

Blockquote → highlight notes, tips, or warnings:

> ⚠️ Always use virtual environments in Python to avoid dependency conflicts.

1. Lists — Organizing Information

Unordered list for bullets:

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

Ordered list for steps:

1. Install Python
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Run your first script

Nested lists:

- Data Types
  - Numbers
  - Strings
  - Lists

---

4. Code Blocks — For Snippets

Use triple backticks (```) with language name for syntax highlighting:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}"
```

---

1. Tables — For Comparisons

| Feature   | Python       | Java       |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Typing    | Dynamic      | Static     |
| Execution | Interpreted  | Compiled   |
| Use cases | Data Science | Enterprise |

6. Sections You Should Use Consistently

Follow the same pattern per doc (like a book chapter):

# Title (Language/Framework/Tool)

## 1. Introduction

- What is it?
- Why use it?

## 2. Installation & Setup

Steps to install and configure.

## 3. Basics

- Syntax
- Core concepts
- Simple examples

## 4. Advanced Concepts

- Patterns
- Edge cases
- Best practices

## 5. Cheat Sheet

Quick commands/snippets.

## 6. Projects / Examples

Mini-projects, hands-on.

## 7. Resources

Links to official docs, tutorials.

---

7. Emphasizing Important Info

✅ Do’s
❌ Don’ts
⚡ Quick tips
🛠️ Tools

✅ Use `venv` for Python projects  
❌ Don’t install packages globally  
⚡ Shortcut: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`

---

8. Links & Images

Link:
[Python Official Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)

Image (for diagrams/screenshots):
![Architecture Diagram](./images/python-architecture.png)

🔗 Linking to Specific Sections in GitHub

## 1. Linking to a Heading in Markdown

GitHub auto-generates anchors for headings.

Format:

```markdown
[Link text](./path/to/file.md#heading-text)
```

---

9. Collapsible Sections (Optional, GitHub-only)

Good for hiding extra details:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand example</summary>

```python
print("Hello World")
```

</details>

---

10. Checklist — For TODOs

- [x] Learn Python basics
- [ ] Complete Django project
- [ ] Explore Kubernetes
